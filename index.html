        <h2 class="section-heading mb-3 mt-3">About me</h2>
        <p>I’m an occupational therapist with a deep passion for mental health and the way the human mind works. I feel privileged to walk alongside people in their most vulnerable moments, while supporting them in recognising and reaching their potential, no matter the challenges they face.</p>
        <p>I graduated Summa Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Science in Occupational Therapy and was inducted into the Golden Key International Honour Society for academic achievement. Over the years, I have completed post-graduate training in Experiential Group Therapy Techniques and skills training in Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT). This has broadened my perspective and strengthened my ability to support people through life’s challenges and transitions. I value continuous learning and growth, allowing me to bring the latest skills, insights, and approaches to best support my clients’ wellbeing.</p>
        <p>I believe healing begins with safety, empathy, and the courage to take small steps. Whether in individual or group therapy, my goal is to provide a space where people feel seen, heard, and supported as they explore their experiences, develop healthier coping strategies, and reconnect with what brings meaning to their lives. In my practice, I integrate practicality, creativity, curiosity, and compassion. Through reflective conversations and expressive techniques, I help clients deepen self-awareness, restore balance, reclaim their sense of agency, and move forward withconfidence.</p>

    <div class="container my-5 ">
      <h2 class="section-heading mb-4">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>Do I need a referral to make an appointment?</h5>
        <p>No referral is needed. You’re welcome to contact me directly to book an appointment.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>How do I book an appointment?</h5>
        <p>You are welcome to contact me via the website form, email, or phone. I’ll get back to you as soon as possible to arrange a time that suits you.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>What can I expect from my first session?</h5>
        <p>Your first session is an important starting point and is usually a bit longer than regular sessions. During this time, I’ll ask a range of questions to get to know you, understand your current challenges, and explore what’s most important to you. The aim is to gain a clear picture of your unique needs, strengths, and goals so that we can tailor therapy to support you effectively. If appropriate, I may also use specific assessments to help us better understand certain areas of functioning and guide the direction of therapy.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>Do I need to prepare anything for my sessions?</h5>
        <p>For your first session, the only preparation needed is to think about what you’d like to achieve in therapy, as well as any specific concerns or challenges you want to explore. If you feel it’s important, you’re welcome to bring along relevant medical or personal history. For follow-up sessions, there’s no need to prepare anything in advance - I’ll guide you as we go, based on your needs and our therapeutic goals.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>How long do sessions last?</h5>
        <p>Follow-up sessions typically last around one hour. However, the exact length may vary depending on how the session progresses - it may be slightly shorter or a bit longer, depending on your needs on the day.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>What age groups do you work with?</h5>
        <p>I work with adolescents, adults, and older adults who are navigating a range of mental health challenges, life transitions, or emotional difficulties.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>Do you offer online sessions?</h5>
        <p>Yes, I offer virtual sessions for individuals who prefer or require remote support. While I do suggest that the first session be in-person, this is not compulsory. I’m happy to adapt to your needs and work in a way that feels most accessible to you.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>How many sessions will I need?</h5>
        <p>The number of sessions differs for each individual. Some clients come for short-term support, while others benefit from long-term therapy. We’ll discuss your needs together and review progress along the way.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>Is everything I share kept confidential?</h5>
        <p>Yes, confidentiality is a fundamental part of therapy. What you share in sessions is private and protected. I will always explain this clearly during our first session.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>How does occupational therapy differ from counselling or psychology?</h5>
        <p>While there can be overlap in addressing thoughts, emotions, and behaviour, occupational therapy focuses on practical strategies for daily life. We take a holistic approach to understanding how emotional, cognitive, social, and environmental challenges affect routines, roles, coping skills, and participation in meaningful activities and occupations. Our treatment approaches and modalities differ but complement one another, and I value collaborating with other professionals as part of a supportive team.</p>
